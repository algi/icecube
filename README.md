# IceCube

Maven frontend that allows launching saved build configurations. It is currently in refactoring stage that will allow to use more windows than one.

## TODO
* refactoring from NSAppDelegate to NSWindowController (in progress)
* creation of more windows (workspaces?) - probably with CoreData
* (maybe) toolbar item similar to that one in Xcode or iTunes
* (maybe) better parsing support - currently running plugin
